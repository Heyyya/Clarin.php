<h1>History and Culture</h1>

<img src="image.jpg" alt="Historical photo of Mahayag">

<p>The Municipality of Mahayag was once an unfamiliar place, unmistakably swampy, darkened by big trees, wild shrubs, and marshes, and the habitat of wildlife. The name Mahayag was derived from the Subanen dialect "Boyed Mahayag," a native term for a forested and mountainous area. It was the Subanen tribe who first lived in the area, particularly along river banks since it is where their economic livelihood is situated.</p>

<p>During the early part of 1939, early Christians explored and settled permanently in the plains of Mahayag in search of plain land for farming. Inferior to them, the Subanen tribe retreated to mountainous areas and settled there.</p>

<p>Social and economic activities were being established, such as "Taboan"; hence, Christian settlers proposed that the place be named "Mahayag," a Cebuano term (ma=to become + hayag=bright) which means to become bright or sunny. When the Visayan migrant first trickled into the area after World War II, the place was heavily forested. Local historical sources said that when the large "DAO" trees which stand in the town site fell, the place became bright, hence the expression "MAHAYAG."</p>

<p>Mahayag used to be a sitio of Barangay Molave, Municipality of Aurora. Early settlers of the area had endeavored for the creation of another municipality to fast-track development, which is possible only by having a distinct political subdivision from the municipality of Molave. On May 9, 1960, by virtue of Executive Order No. 393 issued by His Excellency Carlos P. Garcia, Mahayag became an independent Municipality. The town site for the new municipality was donated by Mr. Zacarias dela Torre and Mr. Pedro Alquizar. The first appointed Municipal Mayor was Hon. Saturnino Mendoza. At present, Hon. Manuel T. Saladaga stands as the 13th Municipal Mayor elected in the Municipality of Mahayag.</p>
